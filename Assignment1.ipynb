    "One popular Agile development framework is Scrum (a paradigm recommended for data science projects). It emphasizes the continual evolution of code for projects, becoming progressively better, but starting with a quickly developed minimum viable product. This often means that code written early on is not optimized, and that's a good thing - it's best to get it to work first before optimizing. Imagine that you wrote the following code during a sprint towards getting an end-to-end system working. Vectorize the following code and show the difference in speed between the current implementation and a vectorized version.\n",
